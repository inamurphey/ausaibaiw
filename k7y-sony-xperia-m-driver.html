Hi everybody, i am trying to install lineage os on my sony xperia xa2. i did everything as described here https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/pioneer/install (https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/pioneer/install) but i always end up with this error: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Error applying Update: 18 (ErrorCode:: kdownlo. As I understand, only Sony Xperia phones have official AOSP support, ie. official complete fully-tested build instructions with periodical updates (if that's not the case, please tell me!): https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/guides/aosp-build-instructions/ Do the Xperia AOSP builds include anything proprietary that's not mandatory ie. closed source apps etc. (not drivers)? Nexus and Pixel phones seem not to have official support, but have reliable support and unofficial guides. Hello, I just bought the Z5C (low price on Amazon, less than 200€), and unlocking bootloader to install LineageOS fails ("FAILED - Remote - Command did not succeed" on the fastboot command).

I'm not really sure about this new "15.1 daily, 14.1 monthly" update scheme. When I first read news about this update schedule change, I immediately didn't understand nor really like the decision. It's not like the Oreo builds are just freshly coming out and there are lots of bugs to be fixed. Changelogs are being emptier and emptier every week, both because there are less bugs to be fixed, and also because (I believe) developers focused their attention to LOS 16.0 based on Pie.
